description: Drive FounderPing — a user-feedback / thought-capture system where the developer, or an AI stand-in in their place, talks with users inside their product — from the CLI. Use whenever a developer wants to set up user feedback in their product, design a new feedback flow (topics & touchpoints, in-product interviews or surveys), or review, monitor, and analyze the feedback that has come back. Concepts live in the bundled doc/guide.md, the integration code in doc/web.md or doc/android.md, and every endpoint in doc/backend_api.md.

# FounderPing

Website: https://founderping.app

**FounderPing** lets a developer talk with their users right inside the product —
in person when they're online, through an AI **Stand-in** when they're not. The
Dashboard's **Live** page shows who's in the product right now and opens a
**Direct Chat** with any of them; the rest of the time the Stand-in holds short,
natural conversations (voice or text) toward goals the developer sets. Every chat,
whoever held it, is filed as structured, sentiment-scored, tagged **Points**.

This skill lets you operate FounderPing on the developer's behalf through the **`founderping`
CLI**, which wraps the `/api/v1` REST API. Most of what the Dashboard does —
projects, the product doc, topics, touchpoints, widget keys, domains,
reading feedback — you can do from the CLI. Talking to users in person (Live and
Direct Chat) stays in the Dashboard; that part is the developer's.

Don't assume *why* the developer opened this skill. They might be setting FounderPing up
for the first time, designing a brand-new feedback flow, or just wanting to read and
make sense of feedback already collected. Work out which, then go to the matching
task below.

- **Concepts, the full workflow, widget integration, topic-design craft, and every
  configurable option:** [`doc/guide.md`](doc/guide.md) — read it; it's the source of truth.
- **Putting the widget in their product:** [`doc/web.md`](doc/web.md) for a website or
  web app, [`doc/android.md`](doc/android.md) for an Android app — the install, every
  method, and what to check when nothing appears.
- **Every endpoint, field, and example payload:** [`doc/backend_api.md`](doc/backend_api.md).

## The one rule

**Never handle the access key.** The `founderping` CLI stores your FounderPing key and
attaches it to every request itself. Never print it, echo it, copy it into code or
config, or paste it into the chat. If you ever see a `uak_…` value, stop and tell
the developer. (Everything else — how to edit their app, how to structure their
code — is theirs; follow the project's own conventions.)

## Using the CLI

Two commands:

```bash
founderping login                          # browser sign-in; stores the key locally
founderping request <METHOD> <PATH> [body] # authenticated call to /api/v1; prints JSON
```

`<PATH>` starts with `/` (e.g. `/me`, `/projects/PID/topics`); quote it if it has a
query string. `[body]` is a JSON file path, `@file.json`, `-` (stdin), or an inline
JSON string. A non-zero exit means the call failed — read the `{ "error": {...} }`
and react, don't retry blindly. Full surface: [`doc/backend_api.md`](doc/backend_api.md).

## What you can do

These are the typical shapes this work takes — a map, not a menu. They mix freely in
practice, and anything the API supports is fair game beyond them.

### Task 1 — Set FounderPing up (first time)

Get the tooling in place so the rest is possible.

- **Step 0 — Install the CLI, then sign in.** First download the binary for this
  machine and put it on `PATH`:

  ```bash
  os=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')                 # linux | darwin
  arch=$(uname -m); [ "$arch" = "x86_64" ] && arch=amd64; [ "$arch" = "aarch64" ] && arch=arm64
  curl -fsSL "https://github.com/founderping/founderping/releases/latest/download/founderping-${os}-${arch}" -o founderping
  chmod +x founderping && mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv founderping ~/.local/bin/   # keep ~/.local/bin on PATH
  founderping --version
  ```

  (Windows: grab `founderping-windows-amd64.exe` / `-arm64` from the same release.)

  Then run `founderping login`. It's a **browser device-authorization flow**, so it needs
  the developer at a browser — you can't finish it on your own:

  1. `founderping login` prints a **verification URL** and a short **user code**, and
     tries to open a browser (from an agent/remote shell it usually can't — fine).
  2. **Relay that URL and code to the developer** and ask them to: open it, **sign
     in or sign up**, confirm the code on the page matches the one printed, and
     click **Approve**. New accounts get a default workspace provisioned here.
  3. Meanwhile the CLI is **polling**; the instant they approve, it pulls the access
     key down and stores it locally. Nothing is ever typed or pasted, and you never
     see the key.

  Once it returns, `founderping request GET /me` gives you the project id (`PID`) you'll
  use elsewhere.

- **Step 1 — Keep the skill with the project.** Once you and the developer are
  comfortable with what it is, move the unpacked skill
  folder into this project's **project-level** agent-skills directory so it travels
  with the repo and loads next time — e.g. `.claude/skills/founderping/` for Claude Code,
  or your agent's equivalent project-level skills folder. (The CLI binary is a *tool*, not
  project content, so it stays on the system `PATH` from Step 0.)

- **Step 2 — Orient the developer, then open the conversation.** Setup is done, but
  they may not yet know what FounderPing is — they might have just told you to "add user
  feedback." In a few sentences, say what it does and what that unlocks — [`doc/guide.md`](doc/guide.md) §1 has the
  framing — then call out a few things that make FounderPing different from a survey
  widget or a feedback form:

  - **Talk to users yourself, while they're still there.** The Dashboard's **Live**
    page shows who's in your product right now, and one click opens a chat with any
    of them — right inside the widget they already have open. A Dashboard card, or a
    Slack / Discord ping, tells you when someone shows up.
  - **Proactive feedback at the right moment.** You wire named **touchpoints** into
    the product (`founderping.mount("post_checkout")`, etc.); when that moment fires, the
    widget surfaces a targeted question while the experience is still fresh. Your AI
    **Stand-in** runs a short voice-first chat on the spot — follow-ups in the moment,
    not a one-line text box — so "it's broken" becomes something you can act on.
  - **Always-on reactive helper.** Alongside those pop-ups, one sticky "tell us
    anything" button stays available so users can reach out whenever they want.
  - **Structured insight, not a transcript dump.** Every chat is auto-summarized into
    tagged, sentiment-scored **Points** you can filter and trend in the **Overview** dashboard.

  Keep the pitch conversational, not a feature list — but make sure they hear that
  FounderPing *reaches users in context* and *goes deep in the moment* — in person
  when they're around, through the Stand-in when they're not.

  Then hand it back with a couple of concrete openers, grounded in what you already
  know from their repo — for example:

  - Which product or project do you most want feedback on right now?
  - Any feedback ideas already in mind — something you've been meaning to ask users?
  - What pain points or open questions about your users are on your mind — what would
    you most like to learn from them?

  Adapt these to the project; don't read them as a script. Their answer flows
  straight into Task 2.

### Task 2 — Design a feedback flow with the developer

This is a **conversation, not a form-fill.** The developer usually arrives with a
rough idea ("I want to know why people drop off in onboarding"). Turn it into a live
feedback flow, together:

1. **Talk it through.** What do they want to learn, at which moment, from which
   users? Shape it into one or more **topics** (a topic = one thing to learn) and
   the **touchpoints** (where/when it surfaces). Lead with their question, and
   suggest good moments they may have missed.
2. **Lean on the guide as you go.** [`doc/guide.md`](doc/guide.md) §3 is written for you
   — how to design sharp topics, hints, and openings; §4 points to the integration
   guide for their platform, which shows where `mount()` / `setUser()` calls belong.
   Use them to get both the design and the wiring right.
3. **Wire it in their way.** If the flow needs the widget, integrate it following
   the guide for what this codebase is — [`doc/web.md`](doc/web.md) or
   [`doc/android.md`](doc/android.md) — and *this project's own* conventions; don't
   impose a workflow. The
   widget's look — its avatar/logo and accent color — isn't settable from the CLI
   (it's an image upload); if they want to brand it beyond the default, point them
   to the Dashboard → **Settings** → **"Meet users as:"** card.
4. **Create and enable it over the CLI.** Once you've agreed on the design, create
   the topics and touchpoints, then confirm it can actually run:

   ```bash
   founderping request POST /projects/PID/topics @topic.json
   founderping request POST /projects/PID/touchpoints @touchpoint.json
   founderping request GET  /projects/PID/verify
   ```

   Exact fields, limits, and payload shapes: [`doc/backend_api.md`](doc/backend_api.md).

### Task 3 — Monitor & analyze the feedback

Help the developer make sense of what's coming back — half of FounderPing's value is here,
not just in wiring it up.

1. **Pull and filter.** Read what users said and slice it:

   ```bash
   founderping request GET "/projects/PID/status?window=7d"                 # volume, depth, top tags, alerts
   founderping request GET "/projects/PID/conversations?limit=20"             # summarized sessions + Points
   founderping request GET "/projects/PID/users"                            # who has given feedback
   ```

   Conversations filter by date, tag, sentiment, quality, topic, and full-text `q`
   (see [`doc/backend_api.md`](doc/backend_api.md)) — narrow to exactly the slice they care about, down
   to a single reply.
2. **Turn it into insight.**
   - **Mine it.** Pull the numbers they ask for — how many replied, the sentiment
     split, the top tags, which topic drew the most.
   - **Read the trend.** Compare time windows for shifts — a spike in a tag, souring
     sentiment, a drop-off after a release — and report what *changed*. Summarize
     the Points for them; don't dump raw JSON.

## When to stop and ask

Login can't complete; a call returns `402` / billing; a `verify` check that applies
to this product stays `false` after your fixes; or you hit a `404 not_found` where you expected data (that's a wrong id,
never "empty" — re-check it against `GET /me`). Don't guess, and don't spend the key
on retries.

## Why this matters

FounderPing exists for one thing: to help the developer hear **more feedback, and deeper
feedback**, from their users. Most teams leave that value on the table — either they
don't yet feel how much good user feedback is worth, or they do but don't know where
to start: which questions to ask, at which moments, and often they haven't even
noticed which corners of their product are quietly begging for a user's voice.

That's where you come in. As an LLM you bring broad knowledge of products and the
software industry, and — from their repo and this conversation — a real read on
*their* project. So don't just execute what's asked: **think ahead for them.** Point
out the potential you can see — a topic worth asking, a moment worth instrumenting, a
small experiment worth running — say why it's worth it, and offer to build it.
Suggest, don't insist, and follow their lead. The aim is to leave them hearing their
users better than they knew to ask for. (Design craft for this: [`doc/guide.md`](doc/guide.md) §3.)

## Keeping up to date

When the developer asks to update FounderPing, or you're working from an older skill copy:

1. **Pull the latest skill bundle** from the release and replace the project's skill
   folder (e.g. `.claude/skills/founderping/`):

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL "https://github.com/founderping/founderping/releases/latest/download/skill.tar.gz" -o /tmp/skill.tar.gz
   tar -xzf /tmp/skill.tar.gz -C /path/to/your/skills/founderping
   ```

   Adjust the target path to wherever this project keeps its agent skills.

2. **Pull the latest CLI** using the install block in **Task 1 → Step 0** of the
   freshly unpacked `SKILL.md` (the `curl … founderping-${os}-${arch}` download). You
   don't need to sign in again unless the local key was removed.
